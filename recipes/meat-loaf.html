    <h2>Best meat loaf ever</h2>

    <p>A few years ago I started experimenting with different meatloaf recipes and creating my own version.<br>
        I finally came up with the best meatloaf I have ever made, and I want to share it.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves gorlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 pound of extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 slices of bread, toasted and crumbed</li>
        <li>7 buttery round crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Worchestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15oz) can tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk, optional</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion and garlic 5 minutes, until onion is tender. 
            Remove from heat, and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the onion and garlic, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, 
            Worcestershire sauce, and 1/2 can tomato sauce.<br>
            Gradually stir in the milk 1 teaspoon at a time until mixture is moist, but not soggy. 
            Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven 40 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C), 
            and continue baking 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup. Pour over the top of the meatloaf, 
            and continue baking 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
