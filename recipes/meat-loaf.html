    <h2>Best Meatloaf ever</h2>

    <p>A few years ago I started experimenting with different meatloaf recipes to create my own version.<br>
        I finally came up with the best meatloaf I have ever made, and I want to share it.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 pound of extra-lean ground beef</li>
        <li>3 slices of bread, toasted and crumbed</li>
        <li>7 buttery round crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>3 1/2 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons Worchestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15oz) can tomato sauce, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk, optional</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons ketchup</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a skillet over a medium heat and cook the onion and garlic for 5 minutes or until the onion is tender. 
            Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl mix the onion, garlic, beef, crumbled bread, crushed crackers, egg, sour cream, 
            Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 of the tomato sauce.<br>
            Gradually stir in the milk one teaspoon at a time until mixture is moist but not soggy. 
            Transfer the mixture to a 5x9 inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) 
            and continue baking for 15 minutes,<br> 
            to an internal temperature of 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>In a small bowl mix together the remaining tomato sauce and ketchup. Pour over the top of the meatloaf 
            and continue baking for 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
