This project uses coding a Recipe Website to practice and demonstrate skills 
in writing multiple Linked Pages with Headings, Text and Linked Images.

Note that if you download the code and want to run it locally you will have 
to change the start of the links to the other directories as they are
currently set up to run remotely from github.
